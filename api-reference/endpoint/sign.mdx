## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for this signature session
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expires_at" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the session expires (5 minutes from creation)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="qr_code" type="string" required>
  Base64-encoded PNG image of the QR code for users to scan
</ResponseField>

### Example Request

```json
{
  "intent": "Sign Terms of Service",
  "signature_information": "I agree to the Terms of Service version 2.1 dated January 11, 2025"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess_1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-11T12:35:00Z",
  "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
}
```

## Webhook Callback

When the user completes the signature, UIP sends a POST request to your webhook URL with the result.

<Note>
**Important:** Webhooks are only sent when the user completes the signature. If the user declines or the session expires without completion, no webhook is sent. Your application should handle timeouts on your end (sessions expire after 5 minutes).
</Note>

### Successful Signature

```json
{
  "event": "sign",
  "data": {
    "uip_id": "user_abc123def456",
    "session_id": "sess_1a2b3c4d5e6f",
    "audit_id": "audit_9z8y7x6w5v4u"
  }
}
```

**Response fields:**
- `event` - Always `"sign"` for successful signatures
- `data.uip_id` - The user's unique UIP identifier
- `data.session_id` - The session ID from your original request
- `data.audit_id` - Permanent audit trail reference ID (save this for compliance)

<Warning>
**Save the audit_id:** This is your permanent proof of signature. Store it in your database for compliance and verification purposes.
</Warning>
