Use this for quick signatures on lightweight agreements, terms of service, policies, and attestations.

### Body Parameters

<ParamField body="intent" type="string" required>
  Description of why you're requesting a signature. Shown to the user in the UIP app.

  **Example:** `"Sign Terms of Service"` or `"Acknowledge Privacy Policy"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="signature_information" type="string" required>
  The content or description of what the user is signing. This is the actual agreement text or reference.

  **Example:** `"I agree to the Terms of Service version 2.1"` or `"I acknowledge receipt of the employee handbook"`
</ParamField>

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.uip.digital/v1/sign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "intent": "Sign Terms of Service",
    "signature_information": "I agree to the Terms of Service version 2.1 dated January 11, 2025"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.uip.digital/v1/sign', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    intent: 'Sign Terms of Service',
    signature_information: 'I agree to the Terms of Service version 2.1 dated January 11, 2025'
  })
});

const { session_id, qr_code, expires_at } = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.uip.digital/v1/sign',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'intent': 'Sign Terms of Service',
        'signature_information': 'I agree to the Terms of Service version 2.1 dated January 11, 2025'
    }
)

data = response.json()
session_id = data['session_id']
qr_code = data['qr_code']
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess_1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-11T12:35:00Z",
  "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
}
```

<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for this session. Use this to poll for results.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expires_at" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the session expires (5 minutes from creation).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="qr_code" type="string" required>
  Base64-encoded PNG data URI of the QR code. Display this to desktop users. The QR code encodes `https://www.uip.id/{session_id}`.
</ResponseField>

## Implementation Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Session">
    Call `POST /v1/sign` with your intent and signature information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR Code or Deep Link">
    Desktop: show the `qr_code` image. Mobile: show an "Open UIP" button linking to `https://www.uip.id/{session_id}`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll for Result">
    Call `GET /v1/sign/:id` every 2-3 seconds until status is `completed` or `expired`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Verified Signature">
    Extract `audit_id` and `uip_id` from the completed response. Save `audit_id` for compliance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**No webhooks needed.** The Sign API uses simple polling. No redirect URIs, no code exchange.
