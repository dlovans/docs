## Welcome to UIP API Reference

This section contains the complete technical documentation for integrating UIP's biometric identity, signature, and messaging services into your application. All endpoints are REST-based with JSON payloads and responses.

<Info>
**New to UIP?** Start with the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) to understand core concepts before diving into endpoint details.
</Info>

## Core APIs

UIP provides three primary APIs that work together to deliver complete identity and signature infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identify API" icon="fingerprint" href="/api-reference/endpoint/identify">
    Biometric authentication and identity verification. Request verified user information like name, age, location, and more.

    **$0.01 per authentication**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sign API" icon="signature" href="/api-reference/endpoint/sign">
    Quick biometric signatures for lightweight agreements. Perfect for TOS, policies, and attestations. 5-minute signing window.

    **$0.03 per signature**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Message API" icon="message" href="/api-reference/endpoint/message">
    Long-term encrypted messaging with optional attachments. Send documents for signature with up to 3 months availability.

    **$0.03 text / $0.10 with attachment**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supporting APIs

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Audit API" icon="list-check" href="/api-reference/endpoint/audit">
    Retrieve permanent audit trails for all actions. Court-admissible evidence with cryptographic proof.

    **Always free**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Invalidate API" icon="ban" href="/api-reference/endpoint/invalidate">
    Cancel pending signature requests before recipients sign. Only works for unsigned messages.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Webhook Test" icon="webhook" href="/api-reference/endpoint/webhook-test">
    Test your webhook endpoint configuration before going live.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication

All UIP API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header of every request.

**Header format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
**Keep your API keys secure.** Never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

### Getting API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create UIP Identity">
    Sign up at [business.uip.digital/identify](https://business.uip.digital/identify) and create your identity with government ID verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive $5 Credit">
    New accounts automatically receive $5 in credits—enough for testing and initial implementation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Create your API key from the dashboard and start making requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Base URL

All API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://api.uip.digital/v1
```

<Note>
**Production only:** UIP doesn't provide a sandbox environment. Use your $5 signup credit for testing with real biometric verification.
</Note>

## Request & Response Format

All requests and responses use JSON format with UTF-8 encoding.

**Required headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Webhook Integration

Most UIP APIs work asynchronously using webhooks. Instead of polling for results, UIP sends POST requests to your webhook URL when actions complete.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Security" icon="shield-check">
    Every webhook request includes an `X-UIP-Signature` header containing an HMAC SHA-256 signature. Your webhook secret is a UUID v4 identifier provided when you create your API key.

    **Verify all webhook requests** to ensure they're from UIP and haven't been tampered with.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Events" icon="bolt">
    Different APIs send different webhook events:

    - **Identify API:** `authentication_completed`, `authentication_failed`, `session_expired`
    - **Sign API:** `signature_completed`, `signature_declined`, `signature_expired`
    - **Message API:** `message_delivered`, `message_signed`, `message_declined`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing Webhooks" icon="flask">
    Use the [Webhook Test endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/webhook-test) to verify your webhook handler before going live. It sends a test payload to your URL and reports the response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## QR Code Flow

The Identify and Sign APIs return QR codes for user authentication. Users scan these codes with the UIP mobile app to complete actions.

**Implementation flow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Session">
    Call the appropriate endpoint (Identify or Sign) with your webhook URL
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR Code">
    Show the returned QR code to users (desktop) or provide app deep link (mobile)
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Scans & Authenticates">
    User opens UIP app, scans code, and authenticates with biometric
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Webhook">
    UIP sends result to your webhook URL with verified identity or signature proof
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Best Practice:** Always ask users if they're on mobile or desktop first. Mobile users can open the UIP app directly without scanning a QR code.
</Info>

## Error Handling

UIP uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error information in the response body.

**Check HTTP status code first:**
- **2xx:** Success
- **4xx:** Client error (fix your request)
- **5xx:** Server error (retry with exponential backoff)

**Then examine the error code:**
```json
{
  "error": "The requested resource was not found",
  "code": "resource/not-found"
}
```

See the [Error Handling Guide](/core-concepts/error-handling) for complete error code reference.

## Rate Limits

<Note>
**No rate limits currently enforced.** UIP may add rate limiting in the future to ensure fair usage and system stability. You'll be notified before any limits are implemented.
</Note>

## Audit Trail

Every UIP action generates a permanent audit record accessible via the Audit API. These records include:

- Complete action details (authentication, signature, message)
- Verified identity information
- Cryptographic proof of action
- Precise timestamps
- Tamper-evident storage

**Audit queries are always free and unlimited.** Store audit IDs from webhook responses to retrieve records anytime.
