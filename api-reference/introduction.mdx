## Welcome to UIP API Reference

This section contains the complete technical documentation for integrating UIP's biometric identity, signature, and messaging services into your application. All endpoints are REST-based with JSON payloads and responses.

<Info>
**New to UIP?** Start with the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) to understand core concepts before diving into endpoint details.
</Info>

## Base URL

All API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://api.uip.digital/v1
```

<Note>
**Production only:** UIP doesn't provide a sandbox environment. Use your $5 signup credit for testing with real biometric verification.
</Note>

## Core APIs

UIP provides three primary APIs that work together to deliver complete identity and signature infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identify API" icon="fingerprint" href="/api-reference/endpoint/identify">
    Biometric authentication and identity verification. Request verified user information like name, age, location, and more.

    **$0.01 per identification**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sign API" icon="signature" href="/api-reference/endpoint/sign">
    Quick biometric signatures for lightweight agreements. Perfect for TOS, policies, and attestations. 5-minute signing window.

    **$0.03 per signature**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Message API (Text)" icon="message" href="/api-reference/endpoint/message">
    Encrypted messaging without attachments. Supports signatures. Perfect for notifications and text agreements.

    **$0.03 per message**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Message API (with Attachment)" icon="file-signature" href="/api-reference/endpoint/message">
    Document messaging with attachments up to 20MB. Supports signatures. Available up to 3 months.

    **$0.10 per message**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audit API" icon="list-check" href="/api-reference/endpoint/audit">
    Retrieve permanent audit trails for all actions. Court-admissible evidence with cryptographic proof.

    **Always Free**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supporting APIs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Authorize API" icon="users-gear" href="/api-reference/endpoint/authorize">
    Platform delegation -- request scoped access to act on behalf of businesses.

    **Always Free**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Invalidate API" icon="ban" href="/api-reference/endpoint/invalidate">
    Cancel pending signature requests before recipients sign. Only works for unsigned messages.

    **Always Free**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Webhook Test" icon="webhook" href="/api-reference/endpoint/webhook-test">
    Test your webhook endpoint configuration before going live.

    **Always Free**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication

All UIP API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header of every request.

**Header format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

UIP supports two types of Bearer tokens:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct API Keys" icon="key">
    Standard UUID-format API keys for businesses making direct API calls. Full access to all endpoints.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delegation Tokens" icon="users-gear">
    Platform delegation tokens (`uip_at_` prefix) generated via the Authorize API. Scoped access based on granted permissions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Keep your API keys secure.** Never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

### Getting API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create UIP Identity">
    Sign up at [business.uip.digital/identify](https://business.uip.digital/identify) and create your identity with government ID verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive $5 Credit">
    New accounts automatically receive $5 in credits -- enough for testing and initial implementation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Create your API key from the dashboard and start making requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request & Response Format

All requests and responses use JSON format with UTF-8 encoding.

**Required headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Session Flow

The Identify and Sign APIs use a simple create-poll-complete flow. No redirect URIs, no code exchange, no webhooks needed.

**Implementation flow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Session">
    Call `POST /v1/identify` (or `POST /v1/sign`) with your intent. You receive a `session_id`, `qr_code` (base64 PNG), and `expires_at`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR Code or Deep Link">
    Desktop users see a QR code to scan. Mobile users get an "Open UIP" button linking to `https://www.uip.id/{session_id}`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Scans & Authenticates">
    User opens UIP app, scans code (or taps deep link), and authenticates with biometric
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll for Result">
    Poll `GET /v1/identify/:id` (or `GET /v1/sign/:id`) every 2-3 seconds until status is `completed`. The completed response includes all verified data directly -- no separate code exchange needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Device detection:** Detect mobile vs desktop and show the appropriate UX. QR code for desktop, deep link button for mobile. See the [QR Integration Guide](/core-concepts/qr-integration) for details.
</Info>

## Webhook Integration

Webhooks are used for the **Message API** and **Authorize API** only. The Identify and Sign APIs use polling instead.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Webhooks Are Used" icon="bolt">
    - **Message API:** `message` event when a user signs or declines a signature-required message
    - **Authorize API:** `authorize.completed` event when a business owner approves delegation
    - **Delegation revocation:** `delegation.revoked` event when a business revokes platform access
    - **Test:** `test` event from the webhook test endpoint
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Security" icon="shield-check">
    Every webhook request includes an `X-UIP-Signature` header containing an HMAC SHA-256 signature. Your webhook secret is a UUID v4 identifier provided when you create your API key.

    **Verify all webhook requests** to ensure they're from UIP and haven't been tampered with.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing Webhooks" icon="flask">
    Use the [Webhook Test endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/webhook-test) to verify your webhook handler before going live. It sends a test payload to your URL and reports the response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
**Identify and Sign do NOT use webhooks.** Use simple polling with `GET /v1/identify/:id` or `GET /v1/sign/:id` until the status is `completed`.
</Note>

## Error Handling

UIP uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error information in the response body.

**Check HTTP status code first:**
- **2xx:** Success
- **4xx:** Client error (fix your request)
- **5xx:** Server error (retry with exponential backoff)

**Then examine the error code:**
```json
{
  "error": "The requested resource was not found",
  "code": "resource/not-found"
}
```

See the [Error Handling Guide](/core-concepts/error-handling) for complete error code reference.

## Rate Limits

UIP enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability:

| Scope | Limit | Window |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Global (per IP) | 500 requests | 1 minute |
| Per API Key | 300 requests | 1 minute |
| Authorize endpoint | 100 requests | 1 minute |

When you exceed a rate limit, the API returns HTTP 429 with:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` -- Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` -- Requests remaining in the current window
- `Retry-After` -- Seconds until the window resets

## Audit Trail

Every UIP action generates a permanent audit record accessible via the Audit API. These records include:

- Complete action details (authentication, signature, message)
- Verified identity information
- Cryptographic proof of action
- Precise timestamps
- Tamper-evident storage

**Audit queries are always free and unlimited.** Store audit IDs from completed sessions and webhook responses to retrieve records anytime.
