## Overview

The Audit API provides immutable, cryptographically verifiable records of all UIP actions—identity verifications, signatures, and messages. Use task hashes to retrieve complete audit trails that meet legal requirements for digital signature verification and identity confirmation.

## How Audit IDs Work

Every UIP action generates a unique audit ID that serves as an immutable reference to the complete transaction. This ID can be used indefinitely to retrieve the full audit trail.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Completes Action">
    User authenticates via [Identify API](/api-services/identify), signs agreement via [Sign API](/api-services/sign), or signs message/document via [Messaging API](/api-services/messaging)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit ID Generated">
    Unique audit ID created and returned in webhook response
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Audit ID">
    Save the audit ID in your database for future audit lookups
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Available Forever">
    Use audit ID to retrieve full audit trail anytime—permanently available
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Important:** Always save audit IDs from webhooks. This is your permanent reference to retrieve audit records for authentications, signatures, and messages.
</Info>

## Getting Audit IDs

All three APIs—[Identify](/api-services/identify), [Sign](/api-services/sign), and [Messaging](/api-services/messaging)—return an `audit_id` in their webhook payloads. Store this ID in your database for future audit lookups.
