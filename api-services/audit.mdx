## Overview

The Audit API provides immutable, cryptographically verifiable records of all UIP actions—identity verifications, signatures, and messages. Use task hashes to retrieve complete audit trails that meet legal requirements for digital signature verification and identity confirmation.

## How Task Hashes Work

Every UIP action generates a unique task hash that serves as an immutable reference to the complete transaction. This hash can be used indefinitely to retrieve the full audit trail.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Completes Action">
    User authenticates via [Identify API](/api-services/identify), signs agreement via [Sign API](/api-services/sign), or signs message/document via [Messaging API](/api-services/messaging)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Hash Generated">
    Unique task hash created and returned in webhook response
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Task Hash">
    Save the task hash in your database for future audit lookups
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Available Forever">
    Use hash to retrieve full audit trail anytime—permanently available
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Important:** Always save task hashes from webhooks. This is your permanent reference to retrieve audit records for authentications, signatures, and messages.
</Info>

## Endpoint

    Store the task hash alongside user session records.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Sign API (Quick Agreements)">
