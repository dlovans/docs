Control how urgently users are notified about your messages with four severity levels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low" icon="bell" defaultOpen>
    **No push notification** - Background delivery only.

    User sees message when they open the UIP app. Perfect for non-urgent notifications, marketing messages, or optional updates.

    **Use for:** Non-urgent updates, promotional content, informational messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Medium (Default)" icon="bell-on">
    **Standard push notification** with default sound and vibration.

    User receives immediate notification but not intrusive. Perfect for most use cases.

    **Use for:** Account notifications, transaction confirmations, general alerts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High" icon="bell-exclamation">
    **Priority notification** with enhanced sound and persistent alert until acknowledged.

    User receives prominent notification that stays visible. Perfect for important actions requiring attention.

    **Use for:** Contract signing requests, security alerts, payment confirmations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Extreme" icon="siren-on">
    **Emergency-level notification** with maximum alert intensity.

    <Warning>
    **Restricted Access:** Extreme severity is only available to verified government and emergency service accounts.
    </Warning>

    Reserved for critical situations requiring immediate action.

    **Use for:** Emergency alerts, public safety notifications, critical government communications
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Document Signing">
    **Scenario:** Send employment contract for signature

    Send a PDF contract with signature request. When the recipient signs, you receive a webhook with the signature proof and audit ID.

    **Benefits:**
    - Legally binding signatures
    - Permanent audit trail
    - No physical paperwork
    - Instant completion
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secure Notifications">
    **Scenario:** Send encrypted account alert

    Send text-only message with sensitive account information. End-to-end encryption ensures only the recipient can read it.

    **Benefits:**
    - No email interception risk
    - Verified recipient identity
    - Delivery confirmation
    - Read receipts
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-Party Agreements">
    **Scenario:** Collect signatures from multiple parties

    Send the same contract document to multiple recipients. Track each signature independently using audit IDs.

    **Implementation approach:**
    1. Send message with attachment to Recipient 1
    2. Save audit ID from webhook response
    3. Send same document to Recipient 2
    4. Save audit ID from webhook response
    5. Continue for all parties
    6. Store all audit IDs together for complete agreement proof

    **Advanced approach:** UIP's modular architecture allows creative solutions:
    - Use metadata to link related signatures
    - Create signature collection workflows
    - Implement approval chains
    - Build custom signature ordering

    **Benefits:**
    - Each signature cryptographically verified
    - Independent audit trails for each party
    - Flexible workflow design
    - Permanent proof of multi-party agreement
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Policy Acknowledgment">
    **Scenario:** Require employees to acknowledge updated policies

    Send policy document to all employees. Track completion with audit records.

    **Benefits:**
    - Proof of acknowledgment
    - Timestamp of acceptance
    - No manual tracking
    - Compliance ready
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Invalidating Messages

If you send a message that requires a signature, you can invalidate it before the recipient signs using the [Invalidate Message API](/api-reference/endpoint/invalidate).

<Info>
**When to Invalidate:** Cancel pending signature requests if terms change, deadlines pass, or the request is no longer needed.
</Info>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Message">
    Send a message with signature request to a recipient
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recipient Hasn't Signed">
    Before the recipient signs, you decide to cancel the request
  </Step>

  <Step title="Call Invalidate API">
    Use the [Invalidate Message API](/api-reference/endpoint/invalidate) to cancel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request Cancelled">
    The recipient can no longer sign the message. They'll see it was cancelled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use cases for invalidation:**
- Contract terms changed before signing
- Recipient should sign updated version
- Request sent to wrong person
- Deadline passed without signature
- Agreement cancelled by another party

<Note>
Once a recipient signs a message, it **cannot be invalidated**. The signature is permanent and stored in the audit trail.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose Severity Wisely" icon="bell">
    Don't overuse high/extreme severity. Users will ignore notifications if everything is urgent.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clear Subject Lines" icon="heading">
    Make subjects descriptive and actionable. "Action Required: Employment Contract" is better than "New Message"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Save Audit IDs" icon="database">
    Always save audit IDs from signature webhooks for permanent proof and compliance.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test Webhooks" icon="webhook">
    Use the [Test Webhook](/api-reference/endpoint/webhook-test) endpoint before going live.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Handle Declines Gracefully" icon="user-xmark">
    Signature declines are normal. Provide clear follow-up actions or retry options.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Optimize PDFs" icon="compress">
    Compress PDFs before sending to stay under the 20MB cumulative limit.
  </Card>
