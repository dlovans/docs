## Privacy Best Practice

<Check>Only request the data you actually need</Check>

Users can see exactly what you're requesting and are more likely to approve minimal data requests. All responses always include the user's `uip_id` regardless of requested fields.

## Request Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request All Available Data" icon="database">
    Omit the `requested_data` parameter or pass an empty array to request all available fields (respecting your account permissions).

    This requests:

    - `full_name`
    - `date_of_birth`
    - `country_of_origin`

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Response

Your webhook endpoint receives authentication results when the user completes or cancels the request.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Success Response">
    **Event:** `authentication_completed`

    Sent when a user successfully authenticates with their biometric.

    **Payload includes:**
    - `event`: Event type (`authentication_completed`)
    - `session_id`: Unique session identifier
    - `status`: `success`
    - `user_data`: Object containing requested identity data
      - `uip_id`: User's unique UIP identifier (always included)
      - `verified`: Boolean indicating government ID verification status
      - Additional fields based on your request
    - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp

      "status": "success",
      "user_data": {
        "uip_id": "uip_user_9876543210",
        "full_name": "Alice Johnson",

    Sent when authentication fails, is cancelled by the user, or expires.

    **Payload includes:**
    - `event`: Event type (`authentication_failed`)
    - `session_id`: Unique session identifier
    - `status`: `failed`, `cancelled`, or `expired`
    - `reason`: Human-readable failure reason
    - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp

    **Common reasons:**
    - User cancelled the request
    - Session expired (5 minutes)
    - User denied data sharing permission
    - Biometric authentication failed
    - User doesn't meet minimum age requirement
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Security

<Warning>
**Always verify webhook authenticity** using the signature header before processing the data.
</Warning>

Every webhook includes an `X-UIP-Signature` header. Your webhook secret is a UUID v4 identifier (without any prefix).

### Signature Verification

Verify the webhook signature using HMAC SHA-256:

1. Get the raw request body (as string)
2. Compute HMAC SHA-256 using your webhook secret
3. Compare with the `X-UIP-Signature` header
4. Only process if signatures match

<Info>
Your webhook secret is available in the [Business Dashboard](https://business.uip.digital) under Settings → API Keys.
</Info>

## Error Handling

Common error responses and how to handle them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized" icon="lock">
    **Cause:** Invalid or missing API key

    **Solution:** Check that your API key is correct and included in the `Authorization` header
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="400 Bad Request" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Cause:** Invalid request parameters

    **Common issues:**
    - `webhook_url` is not a valid HTTPS URL
    - `requested_data` contains invalid field names
    - `device_type` is set to `mobile` but `redirect_url` is missing
    - `min_age` is not a positive integer

    **Solution:** Validate request parameters before sending
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden" icon="ban">
    **Cause:** Requesting restricted data without permission

    **Example:** Requesting `personal_number` without enterprise account

    **Solution:** Remove restricted fields or contact support to upgrade account
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Rate Limit" icon="gauge-high">
    **Cause:** Exceeded rate limits

    **Limits:**
    - Sandbox: 100 requests/minute
    - Production: 1,000 requests/minute

    **Solution:** Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
