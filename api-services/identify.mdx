## Overview

The Identify API authenticates users through their UIP identity and returns verified personal information. Users always see exactly what data you're requesting and can choose to approve or deny the request.

## Request Parameters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="webhook_url (required)" icon="webhook" defaultOpen>
    **Type:** string (URL format)

    URL to receive authentication results. Must be HTTPS in production.

    Your webhook will receive a POST request when the user completes or cancels authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="requested_data (optional)" icon="list">
    **Type:** array of strings

    Specific data fields to request from the user. If empty or omitted, requests all available data.

    **Available fields:**
    - `name` - User's complete legal name
    - `date_of_birth` - Date of birth as Unix timestamp
    - `country_of_origin` - Country where identity was verified (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
    - `expiry_date` - ID card expiration date as Unix timestamp (must be explicitly requested)

    **Default:** `name`, `date_of_birth`, and `country_of_origin` (unless specific fields requested)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="device_type (optional)" icon="mobile-screen">
    **Type:** string

    Indicates the user's device context for optimal flow:
    - `mobile` - User wants to authenticate on their current mobile device
    - `desktop` - User wants to scan QR code with another device

    **Default:** `desktop`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="redirect_url (optional)" icon="arrow-turn-down-right">
    **Type:** string (URL format)

    Deep link URL to return the user to your app after mobile authentication. Required when `device_type: "mobile"`.

    **Format:** `yourapp://auth-callback` or `https://yourapp.com/auth-callback`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="min_age (optional)" icon="calendar">
    **Type:** integer

    **Note:** This parameter is not currently supported. The API always returns `date_of_birth` as a Unix timestamp. Developers must calculate age from the timestamp in their application logic.

    **For age verification:** Request `date_of_birth`, convert the Unix timestamp to a date, calculate age, and apply restrictions in your backend.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="metadata (optional)" icon="tags">
    **Type:** object

    Additional data to associate with the authentication session for your records.

    **Common fields:** user_ip, session_info, internal_user_id, context

    **Note:** Metadata is returned in webhook responses
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Available Data Fields

Control exactly what information you receive. Users will see your business name and the specific data you're requesting.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Fields">
    ### name

    User's complete legal name as verified during identity verification (powered by Didit).

    **Example:** `"Alice Marie Johnson"`

    **Privacy note:** Only request if you need the user's real name.

    **Included by default:** Yes

    ---

    ### date_of_birth

    User's date of birth as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch).

    **Example:** `643852800` (represents May 15, 1990)

    **Note:** Developers must convert Unix timestamp to desired date format. To verify age, calculate age from timestamp in your application logic.

    **Included by default:** Yes

    ---

    ### country_of_origin

    Country where the user's identity was verified, using ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

    **Example:** `"US"`, `"GB"`, `"CA"`

    **Use case:** Geographic restrictions, compliance requirements

    **Included by default:** Yes
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Optional Fields">
    ### expiry_date

    Expiration date of the user's government-issued ID card as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch).

    **Example:** `1861833600` (represents December 31, 2028)

    **Use cases:**
    - Verify ID has not expired
    - Schedule identity re-verification before expiration
    - Compliance requirements for valid identification
    - Prevent fraud with expired documents

    <Info>
    **Must be explicitly requested:** This field is NOT included by default. Add `"expiry_date"` to the `requested_data` array to receive it.
    </Info>

    **Privacy note:** Only request if you need to verify ID validity or have compliance requirements.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Privacy Best Practice

<Check>Only request the data you actually need</Check>

Users can see exactly what you're requesting and are more likely to approve minimal data requests. All responses always include the user's `uip_id` regardless of requested fields.

## Request Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request Default Fields" icon="database">
    Omit the `requested_data` parameter or pass an empty array to request the standard fields.

    This returns:
    - `uip_id` (always included)
    - `name`
    - `date_of_birth`
    - `country_of_origin`

    **Note:** `expiry_date` is NOT included by default—must be explicitly requested.

    **Use case:** Initial user registration where you need complete profile information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request Specific Fields" icon="filter">
    Only request the fields you need for your use case.

    **Example:** Only request name and date of birth.

    ```json
    {
      "requested_data": ["name", "date_of_birth"]
    }
    ```

    This returns:
    - `uip_id` (always included)
    - `name`
    - `date_of_birth`

    **Use case:** Account verification, personalization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request ID Expiry Date" icon="calendar-check">
    Include `expiry_date` to verify the user's government ID has not expired.

    ```json
    {
      "requested_data": ["name", "date_of_birth", "country_of_origin", "expiry_date"]
    }
    ```

    This returns:
    - `uip_id` (always included)
    - `name`
    - `date_of_birth`
    - `country_of_origin`
    - `expiry_date` - ID card expiration date

    **Use case:** Compliance verification, fraud prevention, identity validity checks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Age Verification" icon="id-badge">
    The Identify API always returns `date_of_birth` as a Unix timestamp. Developers must calculate age from this timestamp in their application.

    **To verify age:**
    1. Request `date_of_birth` field (included by default)
    2. Receive Unix timestamp in webhook response
    3. Convert timestamp to date and calculate age in your backend
    4. Apply age restrictions based on your requirements

    **Example calculation:**
    ```
    timestamp = 643852800
    birth_date = new Date(timestamp * 1000)
    age = calculate_age(birth_date, today)
    if (age >= 21) { grant_access() }
    ```

    **Use case:** Age-restricted content, alcohol sales, gambling, mature content verification
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mobile Device Flow" icon="mobile">
    For users authenticating on their mobile device, specify `device_type: "mobile"` and provide a redirect URL.

    Response includes an `app_url` that opens the UIP app directly, skipping the QR code.

    **Use case:** Mobile web apps, progressive web apps
