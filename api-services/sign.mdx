## How It Works

The Sign API provides instant biometric signing through a simple webhook-based flow. Users scan a QR code (desktop) or open the UIP app directly (mobile), review the document text, and sign with their biometric.

## Request Parameters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="webhook_url (required)" icon="webhook" defaultOpen>
    **Type:** string (URL format)

    URL to receive signing results. Must be HTTPS in production.

    Your webhook will receive a POST request when the user completes or declines the signature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="document_title (required)" icon="heading">
    **Type:** string

    Title or name of what the user is signing.

    **Example:** `"Terms of Service v2.1"`, `"Privacy Policy"`, `"Medical Information Accuracy Attestation"`

    **Best Practice:** Include version numbers for policies
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="document_content (required)" icon="file-lines">
    **Type:** string

    Full text content that the user will read and sign.

    **Requirements:**
    - Must be complete and readable
    - User will see this exact text in their UIP app
    - Plain text or markdown supported
    - No HTML tags

    **Best Practice:** Keep concise but complete. Users should be able to read it in under 2 minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="metadata (optional)" icon="tags">
    **Type:** object

    Additional data to associate with the signature for your records.

    **Common fields:**
    - `version`: Document version number
    - `user_ip`: IP address of user
    - `timestamp`: When request was initiated
    - `form_id`: Internal form identifier
    - `session_info`: Additional session context

    **Note:** Metadata is returned in webhook and audit trail
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Request Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Terms of Service">
    **Use Case:** User agreeing to updated terms of service

    The request includes the full terms text and version information.

    **Webhook Response:** Includes signature proof and timestamp for compliance records.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Attestation">
    **Use Case:** Healthcare patient attesting to accuracy of medical information

    The request includes the attestation statement and patient information in metadata.

    **Webhook Response:** Provides audit reference ID for permanent verification.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Privacy Policy">
    **Use Case:** User acknowledging privacy policy changes

    The request includes updated policy text and version tracking.

    **Webhook Response:** Confirms legally binding acknowledgment with cryptographic proof.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Compliance Form">
    **Use Case:** Employee acknowledging safety protocols

    The request includes protocol details and employee identifier.

    **Webhook Response:** Audit trail for compliance documentation.
  </Tab>
