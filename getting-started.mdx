    Your preferred development setup to integrate the API
  </Card>

  <Card title="5 Minutes" icon="clock">
    That's all it takes to get fully set up and ready to build
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 1: Create Your UIP Identity

Your UIP identity is your biometric-secured digital identity. You'll use it to authenticate to the developer console and as a test account during development.

### Download the UIP App

Get the UIP mobile app for your device:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Download on iOS"
    icon="apple"
    href="https://apps.apple.com/app/uip"
  >
    Requires iOS 13.0 or later
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Download on Android"
    icon="android"
    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=digital.uip"
  >
    Requires Android 8.0 or later
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Complete Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the app">
    Launch UIP and tap **"Create New Identity"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Biometric enrollment">
    Follow the prompts to enroll your fingerprint or face recognition. This happens entirely on your device.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identity verification">
    - Scan your government ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID)
    - Take a live selfie for biometric matching
    - Didit, our verification partner, will confirm your identity (typically under 60 seconds)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done!">
    Your UIP identity is now active. You'll receive a unique UIP ID and can start using it immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Privacy first:** Your biometric data never leaves your device. UIP uses cryptographic keys generated from your biometrics without storing the actual biometric templates.
</Note>

### Verification Requirements

To ensure security and compliance, identity verification requires:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accepted Documents" icon="passport">
    - **Passport** (from any country)
    - **Driver's License** (select countries)
    - **National ID Card** (select countries)

    Documents must be current (not expired) and clearly legible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Photo Requirements" icon="camera">
    - Good lighting (not too dark or bright)
    - Clear focus (not blurry)
    - No glare or reflections
    - All corners visible
    - No filters or edits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Liveness Check" icon="user-check">
    During the selfie capture, you'll be asked to:
    - Look directly at the camera
    - Follow simple prompts (turn head, blink, etc.)
    - This prevents fraud from photos or videos
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing Time" icon="hourglass">
    - **Instant:** Most verifications complete in under 60 seconds
    - **Manual review:** Some cases require manual review (1-24 hours)
    - **Status updates:** You'll receive notifications in the app
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 2: Get API Keys

Once you have your UIP identity, you can create API keys. No separate developer registration needed -- authenticate with your UIP identity and you're in.

### Access Developer Console

<Card
  title="Open Developer Console"
  icon="browser"
  href="https://business.uip.digital/identify"
>
  Authenticate with your UIP identity to access the developer console
</Card>

### Authentication Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to console">
    Visit business.uip.digital and click **"Developer Access"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scan QR code">
    A QR code appears on screen. Open your UIP app and scan it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve access">
    Review the permissions request in your app and authenticate with your biometric
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're in!">
    You're now logged into the developer console
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    In the developer console, go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new key">
    Click **"Create New API Key"** and configure:
    - **Name:** Descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Production API", "Development")
    - **Permissions:** Select which APIs to enable (Identify, Sign, Message)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save securely">
    Your API key appears **once**. Copy it immediately and store it securely:
    - Use environment variables
    - Never commit to version control
    - Store in secrets management system
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security critical:** Your API key has full access to your account. Treat it like a password. If compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.
</Warning>

## Understanding the Integration Flow

Here's how a typical UIP integration works:

### Authentication Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="User initiates login">
    User clicks "Login with UIP" in your application
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create session">
    Your backend calls `POST /v1/identify` and receives a `session_id`, `qr_code`, and `expires_at`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR code or deep link">
    Desktop: display the QR code image. Mobile: show an "Open UIP" button linking to `https://www.uip.id/{session_id}`
  </Step>

  <Step title="User scans and authenticates">
    User opens UIP app, scans the QR code (or taps the deep link), and authenticates with their biometric
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll for result">
    Your backend polls `GET /v1/identify/:id` every 2-3 seconds until status is `completed`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive verified data">
    When completed, the poll response includes all requested identity data (name, DOB, etc.) and an `audit_id`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create session">
    Your application creates a user session and logs them in
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Signature Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="User needs to sign">
    User completes a form, agreement, or transaction requiring signature
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create sign session">
    Your backend calls `POST /v1/sign` with intent and signature information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR or deep link">
    Show QR code on desktop or "Open UIP" button on mobile
  </Step>

  <Step title="User reviews and signs">
    User opens UIP app, reviews the signing request, and signs with biometric verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll for result">
    Poll `GET /v1/sign/:id` until status is `completed`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store proof">
    Save the `audit_id` and `uip_id` from the completed response for permanent audit trail access
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do my users need to create UIP identities?" icon="users">
    **Yes.** Every user who will authenticate or sign via your app needs their own UIP identity. This is a one-time setup that takes about 2 minutes.

    You can embed the UIP signup flow in your onboarding process. Direct users to download the UIP app during account creation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test my integration?" icon="vial">
    **Use your $5 signup credit and your own UIP identity for testing.** Create your UIP identity during onboarding, then use it to test the complete authentication and signature flows.

    This gives you the full end-to-end experience before deploying to production.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a user loses their phone?" icon="mobile-screen-button">
    Users can recover their UIP identity on a new device by:
    1. Downloading the UIP app on the new device
    2. Selecting "Recover Identity"
    3. Re-verifying with their government ID and biometric

    All historical audit records remain intact and accessible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?" icon="dollar-sign">
    - **Signup bonus:** $5 in credits when you join UIP
    - **Identify API:** $0.01 per identification
    - **Sign API:** $0.03 per signature
    - **Message API:** $0.03 without attachment, $0.10 with attachment
    - **Audit API:** Always free

    See [full pricing details](/pricing) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do sessions last?" icon="clock">
    - **Identify/Sign sessions:** Expire after 5 minutes
    - **API keys:** Never expire (but can be revoked)
    - **Audit records:** Permanent, never expire
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need webhooks?" icon="webhook">
    **Not for Identify or Sign.** These use a simple poll-based flow -- just poll `GET /v1/identify/:id` or `GET /v1/sign/:id` until completed.

    **Webhooks are used for:**
    - Message signature events (user signs or declines a message)
    - Authorize completion events (delegation token granted)
    - Delegation revocation events

    See the [Webhooks guide](/api-reference/webhooks) for details.
