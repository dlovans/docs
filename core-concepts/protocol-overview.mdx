description: "More than authentication. More than identity. UIP is the foundational protocol for a new era of digital trust, sovereignty, and human-centric technology."

<Info>
**The Vision:** Identity as a human right. Privacy as the default. Trust without surveillance. UIP reimagines digital identity from first principles—putting people first, technology second.
</Info>

## Philosophy

UIP is built on three core principles that guide every decision, feature, and line of code:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identity as Human Right" icon="fingerprint">
    Your identity belongs to you—not to corporations, not to platforms, not to governments. UIP ensures every person can prove who they are without asking permission.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Protocol Not Platform" icon="diagram-project">
    We're building open infrastructure, not a walled garden. UIP is a protocol that anyone can build on, integrate with, and extend—forever.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Biometrics Without Surveillance" icon="eye-slash">
    Biometric technology can empower people or enslave them. UIP proves it's possible to use biometrics for security while preserving privacy.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Endless Possibilities

UIP isn't just for logging in or signing documents. It's foundational infrastructure for any system that requires trust, identity, or proof of human action.

## Technical Architecture

UIP is built on a distributed architecture where users maintain complete control over their identity while enabling businesses to verify and interact with them securely.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Identity Layer">
    Users create a self-sovereign identity through the UIP mobile app with government ID verification (powered by Didit) and biometric enrollment. Identity data stays on device.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Business Integration Layer">
    Businesses integrate UIP APIs to request authentication, signatures, or send messages to users. Simple REST APIs, comprehensive SDKs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verification Layer">
    UIP facilitates the secure exchange between businesses and users, maintaining cryptographic proof without storing personal data. Zero-knowledge architecture.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Layer">
    Every action generates an immutable audit record accessible via reference IDs. Permanent proof of authentication, signatures, and messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Privacy & Security

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Self-Sovereign Identity" icon="hand">
    Users have complete control over their identity. They decide when and how to share information, and can revoke access at any time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Zero-Knowledge Architecture" icon="eye-slash">
    UIP never stores or has access to your private keys or biometric data. We facilitate verification without seeing personal information.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Selective Disclosure" icon="filter">
    Users can choose what information to share. For example, age verification returns only yes/no without revealing birth date.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cryptographic Proof" icon="key">
    Every action is cryptographically signed, providing mathematical proof of identity without centralized verification.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Liveness Detection" icon="heartbeat">
    Advanced anti-spoofing technology prevents attacks using photos, videos, or masks. Real humans only.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Local Biometric Processing" icon="mobile">
    Biometric data processed entirely on device using Secure Enclave (iOS) or Trusted Execution Environment (Android). Never transmitted.
  </Card>

  <Card title="End-to-End Encryption" icon="lock">
    Messages encrypted client-to-client with no intermediate decryption. Not even UIP can read your messages.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Immutable Audit Trail" icon="scroll">
    Every action creates a permanent, tamper-proof record. Perfect for compliance and legal requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Vision

We believe identity should be:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Universal" icon="globe">
    One identity that works everywhere—across apps, services, countries, and platforms. No more creating accounts, remembering passwords, or managing credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Portable" icon="suitcase">
    You own your identity, and you can take it anywhere. Switch platforms, move countries, change devices—your identity follows you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Private" icon="user-secret">
    Your biometric data never leaves your device. Your personal information is disclosed only with your explicit consent. Privacy by design, not as an afterthought.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inclusive" icon="users">
    Everyone deserves an identity. UIP works in every country, supports government IDs from anywhere, and requires only a smartphone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permanent" icon="infinity">
    Your identity isn't controlled by any company or platform. It can't be taken away, locked out, or deleted without your consent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simple" icon="hand-sparkles">
    Complexity is the enemy of security. UIP makes strong authentication as simple as looking at your phone or touching your finger.
  </Accordion>
