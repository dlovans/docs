## Overview

UIP's impersonation protection works through a simple but powerful mechanism: **every business using UIP APIs must have a government-verified identity**. This creates complete traceability and legal accountability, making impersonation a prosecutable crime with clear evidence.

## How Protection Works

### Government-Verified Identity Requirement

Every UIP business account requires the same government ID verification as consumer users:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Identity Verification" icon="id-card">
    Business owners must verify their identity with government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, national ID)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Biometric Verification" icon="fingerprint">
    Live biometric verification (selfie matching) ensures the person creating the account is the real ID holder
  </Card>

  <Card title="Permanent Record" icon="database">
    All verification data is permanently stored and tied to every API request made by that business
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audit Trail" icon="list-check">
    Every authentication or signature request creates an immutable audit record linking back to the verified business owner
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Complete Traceability

When a business makes an API request through UIP:

1. **Request Origin Tracked** - The business's verified UIP account is recorded
2. **Identity Linked** - Government ID and biometric data are tied to the request
3. **Permanent Audit Created** - Immutable record shows who made the request and when
4. **Legal Evidence Available** - Complete chain of evidence for prosecution if fraud occurs

<Info>
Unlike traditional systems where businesses can hide behind corporate entities or fake registrations, UIP requires a **real person with verified government ID** to create and use every business account. This makes impersonation traceable and prosecutable.
</Info>

## Why This Stops Impersonation

### Criminal Liability

Attempting to impersonate another business on UIP means:

<Warning>
**Legal Consequences for Impersonators:**
- Your real government-verified identity is tied to every fraudulent request
- Complete audit trail provides court-admissible evidence
- Criminal charges for identity fraud and impersonation
- Civil lawsuits from impersonated businesses
- No anonymity - your verified ID is permanently linked to the fraud
</Warning>

### Risk vs. Reward

Traditional fraud allows anonymity. UIP makes it impossible:

| Traditional Systems | UIP Protection |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Create fake business accounts easily | Requires government ID verification |
| Hide behind corporate shells | Real person's identity always linked |
| No traceability after fraud | Complete permanent audit trail |
| Limited prosecution evidence | Court-admissible cryptographic proof |
| Low risk, high reward | High risk, guaranteed prosecution |

## User Verification

While the government ID requirement provides the core protection, users can verify legitimate requests:

### What Users See

When scanning a QR code or receiving a request, users see:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Business Name" icon="building">
    The registered business name from the account
  </Card>

  <Card title="Request Intent" icon="message">
    Clear description of why authentication or signature is requested
  </Card>

  <Card title="Verification Status" icon="badge-check">
    Whether the business has completed additional business verification (optional badge)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Request Context" icon="info-circle">
    What data is being requested and why
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### User Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Business Name">
    Verify the business name matches what you expect (exact spelling, correct company)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Intent Message">
    Read the intent carefully - legitimate businesses use specific, clear language identifying themselves
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Context">
    Only approve requests you initiated (clicked a button on their site, started account creation, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch for Red Flags">
    Reject requests with generic intents, urgent language, or from businesses you don't recognize
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Red Flags for Users

<Warning>
Users should **reject and report requests** if they see:
- Generic or vague intent messages (e.g., "Authenticate" or "Sign this")
- Misspelled business names or similar-looking names
- Requests they didn't initiate
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for unnecessary data (asking for all info when only age verification is needed)
- Businesses they've never heard of claiming to be well-known companies
</Warning>

## Reporting Suspected Impersonation

If you suspect a business is impersonating your organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document the Fraud">
    Capture screenshots showing:
    - The fraudulent request (QR code or message)
    - Business name displayed
    - Intent message
    - Date and time
  </Step>

  <Step title="Report to UIP">
    Email [support@uip.digital](mailto:support@uip.digital) with:
    - Your legitimate business name and UIP account details
    - Evidence of the impersonation attempt
    - Description of the fraudulent activity
    - Any affected users or transactions
  </Step>

  <Step title="UIP Investigation">
    UIP security team:
    - Investigates within 24 hours
    - Retrieves the impersonator's government-verified identity
    - Gathers complete audit trail evidence
    - Suspends the fraudulent account immediately
  </Step>

  <Step title="Legal Action">
    With UIP's evidence package:
    - File criminal charges for identity fraud
    - Pursue civil damages
    - Present court-admissible cryptographic proof
    - Complete chain of custody showing the impersonator's verified identity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Evidence Package for Prosecution

When impersonation is detected, UIP provides a complete evidence package:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Impersonator Identity" icon="id-card">
    - Government ID used to create the account
    - Biometric verification data (selfie)
    - Full name and ID details
    - Account creation timestamp
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fraudulent Requests" icon="file-invoice">
    - All API requests made by the impersonator
    - Intent messages claiming to be your business
    - Target users and requested data
    - Timestamps and IP addresses
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audit Trail" icon="list-check">
    - Immutable cryptographic audit records
    - Chain of custody from impersonator's account to each fraudulent request
    - Court-admissible evidence
    - Tamper-proof verification
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Evidence" icon="code">
    - API keys used
    - Webhook endpoints configured
    - Request patterns and volumes
    - Integration details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Protecting Your Business

### Use Clear, Specific Intent Messages

Make it easy for users to verify legitimate requests from your business:

<CodeGroup>

```json Good Intent
{
  "intent": "Sign in to Acme Corp Customer Portal - acmecorp.com",
  "requested_data": ["name"]
}
```

```json Bad Intent
{
  "intent": "Authenticate",
  "requested_data": ["name"]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Always include your exact business name and context in intent messages
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Your Domain" icon="globe">
    Include your official domain name in the intent to help users verify
  </Card>

  <Card title="Educate Users" icon="graduation-cap">
    Train users to check business names and intent messages before approving
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Requests" icon="chart-line">
    Watch for unusual patterns that might indicate impersonation attempts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Business Verification (Optional)

While government ID verification is required for all business accounts, you can complete additional **business entity verification** to receive a verification badge:

<Note>
Business verification is **optional** and provides a trust badge in the UIP app. The core impersonation protection comes from the required government ID verification, not the business badge.

**Business verification requires:**
- Business registration documents
- Tax ID or incorporation papers
- Proof of business legitimacy
- Additional background checks
</Note>

## Why This System Works

### Traditional Fraud Prevention Fails

Most systems try to prevent fraud at the transaction level:
- Email verification (easily faked)
- Phone verification (burner phones)
- Business registration (fake companies)
- Trust badges (stolen or forged)

These fail because fraudsters remain anonymous.

### UIP's Approach: Identity-First

UIP prevents fraud at the identity level:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Real Identity Required">
    Every business account requires government ID verification - no fake identities possible
  </Step>

  <Step title="Permanent Traceability">
    Every action is permanently linked to the verified identity - no anonymity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Legal Accountability">
    Impersonation becomes a prosecutable crime with court-admissible evidence
  </Step>

  <Step title="Risk Deterrent">
    The certainty of prosecution and evidence makes impersonation too risky
  </Step>
</Steps>
