## Security Architecture

UIP is built on a zero-trust, zero-knowledge architecture. Your biometric data never leaves your device, personal information is encrypted with AES-256, and all communications use end-to-end encryption.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero-Knowledge Architecture" icon="eye-slash">
    UIP verifies identity without storing personal data. Biometrics are processed locally on the user's device.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AES-256 Encryption" icon="lock">
    All personally identifiable information is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM, the strongest commercially available encryption.
  </Card>

  <Card title="On-Device Biometrics" icon="fingerprint">
    Biometric templates never leave the user's device. Authentication happens locally with cryptographic proof sent to verify completion.
  </Card>

  <Card title="End-to-End Encryption" icon="shield-check">
    All API communications, webhooks, and messages are encrypted in transit. HTTPS is required for all webhook URLs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Biometric Security

UIP uses government-grade biometric verification with multiple layers of fraud prevention:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liveness Detection" icon="video" defaultOpen>
    The UIP app performs real-time liveness checks during biometric scans to prevent attacks using photos, videos, or masks. Users must demonstrate live presence through interactive prompts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On-Device Processing" icon="mobile-screen">
    Biometric data (fingerprint templates, facial geometry) is processed entirely on the user's device. Only cryptographic proofs are transmitted — never raw biometric data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Government ID Verification" icon="id-card">
    Identity verification is performed through Didit, a government-grade verification provider. Users scan official documents (passport, driver's license, national ID) with live selfie matching.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Anti-Spoofing" icon="shield-halved">
    Multi-factor anti-spoofing combines document authenticity checks, biometric liveness detection, and cross-reference validation to prevent identity fraud.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Security

### Authentication

All API requests require Bearer token authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

API keys are SHA-256 hashed before storage — UIP never stores plaintext keys. Keys support two authentication modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct API Keys" icon="key">
    Standard UUID-format API keys for businesses making direct API calls. Full access to all endpoints.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delegation Tokens" icon="users-gear">
    Platform delegation tokens (`uip_at_` prefix) generated via the Authorize API. Scoped access based on granted permissions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Rate Limiting

UIP enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability:

| Scope | Limit | Window |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Global (per IP) | 500 requests | 1 minute |
| Per API Key | 300 requests | 1 minute |
| Authorize endpoint | 100 requests | 1 minute |

When rate limited, the API returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.

### SSRF Protection

Webhook URLs are validated against SSRF attacks. UIP blocks webhook delivery to:

- Private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
- Loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1)
- Link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16)
- IPv6 unique local addresses (fc00::/7)

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhook payloads include an `X-UIP-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. Verify this signature to ensure webhook authenticity:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  );
}
```

<Warning>
**Always verify webhook signatures.** Without verification, attackers could send fake webhook payloads to your endpoint.
</Warning>

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest

All PII (names, dates of birth, countries) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage. Encryption keys are managed separately from encrypted data.

### Encryption in Transit

All API communications use TLS 1.2+. Webhook URLs must use HTTPS — HTTP endpoints are rejected.

### Data Minimization

UIP follows the principle of least privilege for data:

- Only return identity fields explicitly requested in `requested_data`
- Session data expires automatically (5 minutes for identify/sign sessions)
- Completed session data is returned once via polling and then cleared
- Audit records store only what's needed for legal compliance

## Compliance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GDPR" icon="shield-check">
    Zero-knowledge architecture with user-controlled data. No personal data stored without explicit consent.
  </Card>

  <Card title="eIDAS" icon="certificate">
    Electronic signatures meet EU requirements for advanced electronic signatures with identity verification.
  </Card>

  <Card title="ESIGN Act" icon="flag-usa">
    Signatures comply with US Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.
  </Card>

  <Card title="SOX" icon="building-columns">
    Audit trails support Sarbanes-Oxley compliance with permanent, tamper-evident records.
  </Card>

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Store Keys Securely" icon="vault">
    Use environment variables or secrets management. Never commit API keys to version control.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Verify Webhooks" icon="shield-check">
    Always validate the X-UIP-Signature header before processing webhook payloads.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock">
    All webhook URLs must use HTTPS. API calls are HTTPS-only by default.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Minimize Data Requests" icon="minimize">
    Only request the identity fields you need. Users are more likely to approve minimal data requests.
  </Card>
