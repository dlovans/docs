## Error Response Format

All UIP API errors follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "error": "The requested resource was not found",
  "code": "resource/not-found"
}
```

<Info>
**Best Practice:** First check if the HTTP status code is **not 2xx**. Then examine the `code` field for specific details about what went wrong.
</Info>

## How to Handle Errors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check HTTP Status Code">
    Verify if the response status code is in the 2xx range (success) or not.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Examine Error Code">
    If status is not 2xx, read the `code` field for specific error details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take Appropriate Action">
    Use the error code to determine how to handle the error (retry, show message, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## HTTP Status Codes

UIP uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Meaning | When It Occurs |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **200** | Success | Request completed successfully |
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters or format |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| **403** | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Server-side issue |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | Temporary service disruption |

<Note>
**Rate Limits:** Currently, no rate limits are enforced on UIP APIs. However, rate limiting may be added in the future to ensure fair usage and system stability.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Check Status Code First" icon="hashtag">
    Always check HTTP status code before parsing error details. Non-2xx means an error occurred.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Specific Error Codes" icon="list-check">
    Don't just check for 400 or 500. Use the `code` field for specific handling.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Implement Retry Logic" icon="rotate">
    Retry server errors (5xx) with exponential backoff. Don't retry 4xx errors (client errors).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Retry 4xx Errors" icon="ban">
    Client errors won't succeed on retry. Fix the request instead.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Error Rates" icon="chart-line">
    Track error rates by code to identify integration issues early.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Log Error Details" icon="clipboard-list">
    Always log error code and message for debugging purposes.
