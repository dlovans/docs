## How it works

A simple flow for every integration: create a session, display a QR code, poll for completion, and receive verified data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session">
    Call the API with your intent. You get back a `session_id`, `qr_code`, and `expires_at`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display QR code or deep link">
    Desktop users see a QR code to scan. Mobile users get an "Open UIP" button that deep links into the app.
  </Step>

  <Step title="User authenticates biometrically">
    The user opens the UIP app, reviews the request, and approves with their fingerprint or face.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll and get the result">
    Poll `GET /v1/identify/:id` until the status is `completed`. The response includes all verified data -- no separate code exchange needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>
