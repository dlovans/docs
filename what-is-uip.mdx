description: "Understanding the Universal Identity Protocol and how it works"
---

## Overview

UIP (Universal Identity Protocol) is a biometric-first, self-sovereign identity and signature protocol that replaces passwords, fragmented logins, and traditional document signing with one cryptographically secure, government-verified identity.

<Info>
**One identity. Verified everywhere.** Your fingerprint or face becomes your universal authentication method across all digital services.
</Info>

## The Problem UIP Solves

### Identity Fragmentation

Traditional systems require users to:
- Create dozens of username/password combinations
- Remember and manage multiple credentials
- Go through different verification processes for each service
- Repeat identity verification for every new account

### Security Vulnerabilities

Password-based systems are inherently insecure:
- Passwords can be stolen, guessed, or phished
- Weak passwords are common
- Password reuse creates cascading security risks
- Two-factor authentication adds friction without solving the core problem

### Document Signing Complexity

Traditional signing processes are inefficient:
- Print, sign, scan, and email documents
- Multiple platforms for different types of signatures
- Unclear legal validity across jurisdictions
- No permanent audit trail

## How UIP Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="One-Time Enrollment">
    Users download the UIP app and complete government ID verification with a live biometric check. This happens once and works everywhere.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Biometric Authentication">
    Your fingerprint or face becomes your password. Cryptographic keys are generated and stored securely on your device.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Universal Access">
    Use UIP to authenticate to any service, sign any document, or verify your identity—all with a simple biometric scan.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Permanent Audit Trail">
    Every action generates a unique reference ID with immutable proof of who did what, when.
  </Step>
</Steps>
